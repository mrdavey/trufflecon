### Course content

This is a 3.5 hour workshop on programmatic smart contract security. It describes how to use a fuzzer, [Echidna](https://github.com/trailofbits/echidna/), and a symbolic analysis toolkit, [Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore), to review the security of smart contracts and prove correctness of certain functionality.
